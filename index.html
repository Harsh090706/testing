            <p class="fade-in">
                I am writing this letter with all the sincere feelings from the bottom of my heart. First of all, I want to say: please forgive me, Peru :(.
                 I know the word 'sorry' might not seem like enough because I've used it so many times, but this is the most honest feeling I have right now.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                I want to sincerely apologize for my repeated mistakes. I hate that I keep slipping up and hurting you in the same ways over and over again.
                I am especially sorry for not informing you about everything and for keeping things in the dark. You deserve total honesty and transparency, and I failed to give you that. I shouldn't have hidden anything from you.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                I also want to say sorry for my recent behavior. It was unacceptable and unfair to you. I realize now that my actions caused you unnecessary stress and sadness.
                I should have communicated better instead of acting out. I am trying my best to learn and fix this aspect of myself because I never want to be the reason for your tears.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                There is no excuse to justify what I did. I fully realize I was wrong.
                Every second without you feels so heavy. I miss you, your voice, your face, and all the little things we used to do together. Your presence means everything to me, and I deeply regret risking our happiness with my stupidity.
            </p>
            
            <p class="fade-in">
                I don't expect you to forgive me right away. I know this is my fault. So I deserve it if you are angry. I can only say I'm sorry to you. I'm really sorry my Sweetheart ❤️
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                I love you so much, more than I can write here.
            </p>
