            <p class="fade-in">
                I am writing this letter with all the sincere feelings from the bottom of my heart. First of all, I want to say: please forgive Zaky :(.
                 I know the word 'sorry' might not be enough to fix everything, but this is the most honest thing I can say.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                I apologize for being harsh with you two days ago. I forced you to stop participating in that dance organization, even though you couldn't because you had made a promise to yourself and your friend. 
                I also apologize for suddenly bringing up the past, discussing your family, and talking about family problems that you weren't ready to share yet, but I forced you. I am so sorry :( 
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Basically, I really want to apologize to you for getting angry for no clear reason two days ago, even though you just wanted to be cheered up and listened to.
                Instead, I got angry over something unclear. I only realized it the next morning. I felt so rude, my words were uncontrolled, and I was even disappointed in myself because my own words made me too afraid to contact you.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                There is no excuse to justify what I did. I fully realize I was wrong and have made you disappointed and sad.
                Every second without you feels so heavy. I miss you, your voice, your face, and all the little things we used to do together, even if just over chat and calls. Your presence means more than anything, and I deeply regret wasting it with my stupidity.
            </p>
            
            <p class="fade-in">
                I don't expect you to forgive me right away. I know this is purely my mistake, all because of my ego. So I deserve to be scolded or hated. I can only say I'm sorry to you. I'm really sorry my Sweetheart ❤️
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                I love you so much, more than I can write here.
            </p>
